The silly url shortening service. No one asked for it, no one wants it.

## Project Closed

I no longer deal with nodejs and the service was using woefully out of date libraries.  The git history shows the original express app.

What exists now is the static html and a script I used to generate all of the links that were in the database.  All existing links should function as before, but the site no longer shortens URLs.
